\begin{abstract}
Entropy measures uncertainty but not structure. Random noise achieves maximal entropy, yet contains little usable order. We propose a companion quantity, the \emph{Organization Index}, which measures the efficiency of retrieval in a system. Defined as the ratio of an information-theoretic baseline (e.g.\ $\log n$ or $H(P)$) to the expected number of steps required to locate an element, the index quantifies how well-structured a system is. We analyze variants (entropy-aware, discount-based), illustrate behavior on toy examples, and study robustness under perturbations. Our framework distinguishes comparison-based organization (bounded at unity) from ``super-organized'' structures (scaling with $\log n$). We suggest that this approach may seed a general theory of organization, complementing information theory by capturing efficiency of access rather than unpredictability.
